# 1 Test methods in PyTest
  # PyTest is a popular testing framework for Python that allows you to write simple and scalable test cases.
  # Test methods in PyTest are functions that start with the prefix test_ and are used


# To display the Test menthod Run icon,
# 1. Make sure you have these extensions installed:
    # Python (by Microsoft)
    # Pylance (recommended for Python)
    # Pytest (optional but helpful)
# 2. Enable testing:
    # Open Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac)
    # Type: Python: Configure Tests
    # Choose pytest
    # Choose the folder (e.g. src/PyTest)
    # VS Code will detect test functions starting with test_
